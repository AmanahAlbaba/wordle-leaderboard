# wordle-leaderboard
# What it is: Wordle Leaderboard will calculate scores based on your daily guesses in your discord server and rank you amongst other memebers in your server for the popular New York Times Wordle game.
# How it works: Send a wordle score in a channel and the bot will store that value in a unique .csv file based on your Discord ID. If you want to check your current stats you can use the $myStats command and it will return your total number of guesses, number of games played, your current ranking, and your average number of guesses. If you use the $leaderboard command it will return the rankings based off average number of guesses among other users in your server
